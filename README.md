# TCNGAN: Generative Adversarial Network for Financial Time-Series

## Goal:
TCNGAN are developed by adding TCN block to vanilla GAN for finanical time-series data generation to support strategy backtesting and modification.

## Discussion:
First, the model can be improved to incorporate prior information to better estimate the tail.
Second, the baseline models should include traditional financial statistical model for thorough evalualtion.

## Result:

**TCNGAN Generated Cumulative Log Return**
